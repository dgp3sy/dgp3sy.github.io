            <h1>Interests</h1><br>
              <p>I am currently pursing a Bachelor's Degree at the University of Virginia, with a double major in Computer Science and Economics. I am interested in a career in Software Development, preferrably within the financial services industry. I have a special passion for working on projects that involve anything relating to computer programming. I am always thinking of processes that I encounter in school, work, and life that can be automated to save time and money. In addition, I have also invovled projects involving data analysis and machine learning. This past semester, I completed a course about the Foundations of Data Analysis, where we learned about Principal Value Decomposition, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Image Recognition, among other things. This was extremely interesting, challenging, and rewarding. This class broadened the horizions of what I thought I was capable of, and gave me further insight into how Artificial Intelligence actually works and what role it will play in our lives. While I am more interested in software development as a career, I do enjoy working on projects involving data analysis in my free time. In addition, I took a Computer Architecture course which sparked my interest of how the underlying components of a computer work, and what I can do as a software developer to optimize the software I write based on my understanding of the hardware. To understand computer hardware better, I purchased a Rasberry Pi and will be embarking on a number of projects to play around with the computer. I first plan to build a server to house a website and SQL database using the Pi.

              Outside of school, I am interested in hiking, fishing and golfing. I am a National Parks enthusiast and I want to visit all 61 Parks in the United States. Some of my favorite trips have been to Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Acadia National Park. I also enjoy reading, and I am always looking for book recommendations, particularily classic literature as well as personal development books. I am currently reading <i>The Tipping Point</i> by Malcolm Gladwell and <i>East of Eden</i> by John Steinbeck.

            <h1>Activities</h1><br>
              <h4>Teaching Assistant for CS 1110: Introduction to Programming</h4>
              <p>
                I support the education of over 600 students each semester in Computer Science 1110: Introduction to Programming through in-class assistance, written feedback, and facilitation of laboratory projects. The focus of this course rests in introducing students to the language of Python, and the foundations of designing and implementing computer programs. I assist in progressing the course by providing additional exam questions and developing coursework for future semesters. I also received training on ethics, diversity, classroom management and teaching techniques for CS courses.

              <h4>Virgina Ambassadors</h4>
              <p>
                Virginia Ambassadors is an organization within the Office of Admissions at the University of Virginia that serves as a liaison between prospective students and current students enrolled at the University. I serve on the Executive Board as the chair of Hoos Online, where I oversee the online operation of the club. This includes the online chat forum that connects current students with prospective students and provides a secure environment were prospective students can ask questions and receive instant meaningful answeres. As the chair of this program, I intent to use the tool to reach out to students who may be unable to attend the school for an official campus visit due to a number of reasons including the cost of the trip or the consequences of missing school or work. I plan to create a forum specifically for first-generation individuals with first-generation college student panelists, to answer questions that the prosepctive student's parents may not know as well as provide insight into the experiences the college students have faced. In addition to this project, I am also developing a website that will allow the club to track its member's volunteer hours and use the data to enhance the quality of operations. In addition to this posiiton, I also volunteer in the office on a weekly basis to interact with students and parents and assist the Admissions Deans in administrative tasks. Furthermore, I serve as a Team Leader for the Days on the Lawn program, a series of prospective student events that is hosted for over 4,000 individuals on a yearly basis. As Team Leader, I serve to help coordinate the event as well as lead and direct volunteers to ensure that the program runs smoothly and represents the University accordingly.

              <h4>Virginia Consulting Group</h4>
              <p>
                I work with companies on the East Coast to provide consulting services to help implement systems and grow their business. This semester I am working with Culinary Institute of America in order to comprise data analysis and marketing strategies. In past semesters, I worked with Dominion Energy for a project involving competitive analysis. Virginia Consulting Group also provides professional development programs to further the skill sets of its members.

              <h4>ACC Leadership Symposium 2018</h4>
              <p>
                In February 2018, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the ACC Ladership Symposium, an event that is funded by the ACC Championship Game. This event provides students at each ACC school with the opportunity to travel to a rotating host campus and network with other students and discuss the impact that we can have within our prospective schools. Applicants are chosen based on merit and leadership roles that they have within their school. While attending the conference at Duke University, we listened to lecture from leaders within their profession, and worked on a project over the course of three days that we presented to the entire conference body. The theme of the conference was courageous leadership, which involved disuccussions and engagements on how to be a leader in a variety of settings. This experience allowed me to take the skills I learned both into the workplace as well as to my organizations at school.
