    <!-- 9. let's add jumbotron header
        Bootstrap jumbotron header is one big, attention-grabbing header 
        (that people view it as "modern" but we may view it as "space-wasting")
        
        To add a jumbotron header, as usual, bootstrap requires it to be in a container
        (we'll comment out / remove the "Hello world!" and add the header)

            This past summer, I worked as a Software Development Intern and developed a mobile application during the 3 months I was there. I worked on a team of interns,
            and we were able to release a mobile application in that timeframe with no previous knowledge of mobile development. This opportunity taught me the ability
            to quickly learn a new type of development space as well as new languages and frameworks, since we primarily used C# and .NET Core. 
            <br></br>
            In addition to the hard skills I developed, while working on this project, I was also able to gain skills related to working in the software development industry. We worked in an Agile setting, with daily SCRUM meetings, two week sprints, biweekly backlog groomings, code reviews, and had a team consisting of a Scrum Master, Product Owner, Manager, and Senior Developers who served as mentors throughout the process. In addition, I learned how to use TFS to manage work through PBIs, burndown charts, and version control using Git. We also harnessed our skills releasing the final project using the TFS build and release manager. This was an incredible opportunity that not only showed me quality of work I could produce on a long term project, but also sparked my interest in Software Development as a full-time career.
            <br></br>
            In addition to the real world experience I gained in my intended line of work, I was also extremely grateful to work in an industry that excites me. As a double major of Computer Science and Economics, I am interested in working as a Software Developer in the financial services industry. My Economics major allows me to have a greater appreciation for the work we are doing within the industry. In addition, it allows me to have a greater insight while working on the software, and see user needs, further possibilities of use, and have a greater understanding of the role that the system will serve for the business. In addition to the work that I did this summer, I also received Financial Industry Training to further understand the financial industry as well as the role of the Broker-Dealer. I appreciated these trainings and they served as a real world application to my studies in college.

        <h1>The Process</h1>
        <p>
        During my time working on this project, I focused on working on the Android Application, which I chose because I wanted to broaden my horizons, as primarily an Apple User. While I helped with the backend of the iOS portion, which was developed using Xamarin.Forms, I focused on the full stack development on the Android Application. This was an incredibly rewarding experience, because it allowed me to understand the full scope of the project, and allowed me to gain insight on how I would stucture the work I needed to complete each sprint. The android development was done using Xamarin Android, because I wanted the users to have a native feel while using the application, in order to grant them primier user experience. The User Interface was designed using AXML, which is android specific, and the backend work was done using C#, which is driven by Xamarin. The use of Xamarin allowed both teams to share backend code of the mobile application throughout the entire process. In addition to the full stack development, we also used a SQL database to house data that persists throughout the application. This allowed me to expand upon the SQL skills that I have learned in classes at school. In addition, I worked on the API calls to pull JSON information that would be displayed, which I found extremely interesting since that allowed the dynamic to be functional even as the business developed after our internship was over. We also implemented a number of security measures in order to protect the information displayed on the application. Throughout the entire process, I had fun gaining a new skill set and I earned an appreciation for all the work I accomplished throughout the summer. This project was much more rewarding than simple data entry or minor bug fixes that some of my peers from school worked on because it allowed me to earn hands-on experience into the development of a real project that creates value to the company.

            The final product shown below uses testing data, therefore none of the information below relates to an actual person, but is rather used to show functionality of the interface. The target user of the end product was the executives at the company, who would use the mobile application while interacting with clients face to face. Both the target user and the intended use of the application was extremely important and guided the design of the User Interface of the application. When the application is loaded, the user is directed to the home screen, where they are able to choose next where to navigate using the bottom navigation bar. Each click on the navigation bar will display a fragment of User Interface, which allows the application to load the screen faster than a new page. 
            <br></br>
            The user can then search for advisor information using first name, last name, or a unique identifying code. This search function is handled using auto-complete and will query the underlying database accordingly to show search results of that text and similar text using wildcard search. The search will fill a list view with advisor information, including name and picture, which are the two essential points of data that the user would need to pull up the information of the individual they are networking with. Once the user selects an advisor, they are able to see additional information about the performance of the individual within the firm, as well as contact information. The user can see additional categories of information using the dropdown menu that is placed directly below the header. The application was designed to display the most pertinent data to the user first, which would enhance the quality of interactions between the user and the clients. The user has the option to write notes about the individual or add them to a specific favorites list in order to quickly return to the user later.

    <!-- 11. Use a grid-like idea for the content layout
        Grids are rows that contain columns. 
        Bootstrap works on a 12-column system. 
        
        The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:
          xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
          sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
          md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
          lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)
        
        Let's assume we will use the md class 
        To have two columns (50% width each in full-screen width), use col-md-6. 
        These two columns will stack on mobile and become 100% width.
        (col-md-x specifies that we are using a medium size column)

    <!-- 12. Let's create 3 columns, same width
        (note: to have columns with different widths, change the x in col-md-x to
        any numbers as long as the total is 12)
