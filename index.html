            <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>
              <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Virginia, where I earned a Bachelor's Degree with Distinction. I double majored in Computer Science and Economics. Upon graduation, I am working as a Systems Integration Consultant in the technology industry in Denver, Colorado. I am interested in a career in Software Development and I have enjoyed working on projects through school, work, and personal interests. I have experience with large scale projects involving Java, Python, C++, and Web Development. I have also enjoyed projects in Data Analysis including building a Neural Network from scratch, Character Recognition, and Machine Learning. <br></br>

               In college, I served as the Online Services Chair for Virginia Ambassadors, the Office of Admission's student volunteer group and provide academic advising to younger students. In addition, I have applied my skills to provide consulting services for Dominion Energy and the Culinary Institute as a part of the Virginia Consulting Group. Through these projects, I have provided Data Analytics and Competitive Analysis of each company's role within their respective industry. In five years, I hope to be a professional in Software Engineering where I am excited to go to work everyday and can apply ethical technology standards and critical thinking to solutions.
